    explain how to design such a multimodal system based on the image in details , showcasing the different mile stone of this project overall architecture and the different unit architecture and the integration pipeline

This image presents a detailed architecture for a multimodal system designed to process and generate content across various modalities. Let's break down the system's components and integration pipeline:

1. Input Stage:

   - The system starts with a "Prompt" input, which could be text, image, audio, or video.
   - There's also a "Prompt Dataset" that feeds into the system, likely providing training or reference data.

2. Global Classifier:

   - This component analyzes the input prompt and classifies it into different modalities (image, audio, text, video).
   - It determines which specific sub-classifiers and processing units to activate.

3. Prompt Rectification Unit:

   - This stage likely refines or adjusts the input based on the global classification.

4. Sub-Classifiers:

   - Multiple specialized classifiers for different modalities:
     - Sub classifier 2image (for image processing)
     - Sub classifier 2audio (for audio processing)
     - Sub classifier text (for text processing)
     - Sub classifier image2 and audio2 (possibly for more specific subtasks)
   - These classifiers perform detailed analysis within their respective domains.

5. Second Prompt Rectification Unit:

   - Further refines the processed information from sub-classifiers.

6. Diffusion and Transformation Stage:

   - Image diffuser: Likely for generating or manipulating images
   - Audio diffuser: For audio generation or modification
   - Large Language Model: For text processing and generation
   - Vision Transformer: For advanced image understanding and generation
   - Speech Transformer: For speech processing and synthesis

7. Output:
   - The system produces "Output MultiModal Content", combining results from various modalities.

Integration Pipeline:

1. The prompt and dataset are fed into the Global Classifier.
2. The Global Classifier determines the relevant modalities and activates appropriate sub-systems.
3. The first Prompt Rectification Unit adjusts the input based on global classification.
4. Sub-classifiers perform detailed analysis on their respective modalities.
5. The second Prompt Rectification Unit further refines the processed information.
6. Diffusion and transformation modules generate or modify content in various modalities.
7. All processed information is combined to produce the final multimodal output.

Key Milestones in Developing This Architecture:

1. Designing and implementing the Global Classifier
2. Developing specialized sub-classifiers for each modality
3. Creating effective prompt rectification units
4. Implementing state-of-the-art diffusion and transformation models
5. Integrating all components into a cohesive pipeline
6. Ensuring efficient data flow and processing across the system
7. Optimizing the system for real-time performance and scalability

This architecture showcases a comprehensive approach to multimodal AI, capable of understanding and generating content across various forms of media in an integrated manner.

    now based on this system specification:
    This image presents a detailed architecture for a multi-modal system designed to process and generate content across various modalities. Let's break down the system's components and integration pipeline:

Based on the system specification, I'll propose an architecture for multimodal input prompt decomposition into chunks, each surrounded by instruction tags representing the specific modality. This will be the first stage of the process, preparing the input for the Global Classifier. Here's a diagram using ASCII art to illustrate this architecture:

```
                 +-------------------+
                 |   Multimodal      |
                 |   Input Prompt    |
                 +-------------------+
                           |
                           v
              +---------------------------+
              |  Prompt Parser & Chunker  |
              +---------------------------+
                           |
                           v
   +-----------------------------------------------+
   |                                               |
   |  +----------------+  +----------------+       |
   |  | <text>         |  | <image>        |       |
   |  | Text chunk 1   |  | Image chunk 1  |       |
   |  | </text>        |  | </image>       |       |
   |  +----------------+  +----------------+       |
   |                                               |
   |  +----------------+  +----------------+       |
   |  | <audio>        |  | <video>        |       |
   |  | Audio chunk 1  |  | Video chunk 1  |       |
   |  | </audio>       |  | </video>       |       |
   |  +----------------+  +----------------+       |
   |                                               |
   |  +----------------+                           |
   |  | <text>         |                           |
   |  | Text chunk 2   |                           |
   |  | </text>        |                           |
   |  +----------------+                           |
   |                                               |
   +-----------------------------------------------+
                           |
                           v
              +---------------------------+
              |    To Global Classifier   |
              +---------------------------+
```

This architecture works as follows:

1. Multimodal Input Prompt:
   The system receives a complex input that may contain multiple modalities (text, image, audio, video).

2. Prompt Parser & Chunker:
   This component analyzes the input and breaks it down into distinct chunks based on modality. It identifies the type of content for each chunk.

3. Tagged Chunks:
   Each chunk is wrapped with specific tags indicating its modality:

   - `<text>` for text content
   - `<image>` for image content
   - `<audio>` for audio content
   - `<video>` for video content

4. Chunk Organization:
   The chunks are organized in the order they appear in the original input. This preserves the context and relationship between different modalities.

5. To Global Classifier:
   The tagged and chunked input is then passed to the Global Classifier for further processing.

This approach offers several advantages:

- Clear Separation: Each modality is clearly defined and separated.
- Preserved Context: The original order and relationship between chunks are maintained.
- Flexible Processing: The Global Classifier can easily identify and route each chunk to the appropriate sub-classifier.
- Scalability: New modalities can be added by introducing new tags.
- Efficient Processing: Each chunk can be processed independently or in parallel if needed.

This decomposition stage sets up the input for efficient processing through the rest of the pipeline, allowing the system to handle complex, multimodal inputs in a structured manner.

---

    now given the above architecture define th earchitecture of the prompt parser and chunker using an LLM (we use phi3) with system prompts
    like this one here
    ```
    import lamini
    lamini.api_key = "712366712c83da4dcb7ef363156c9f7aa5d6bed985f7db02982aba5c5aa27cdf"

    llm = lamini.Lamini("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct")
    print(llm.generate("How are you?"))
    ```
    to detect the parts of the prompts which are specific to the different modality (or you can use clustering machine learning logic to classify them into clusters which represents chunks or partial prompts related to a specific modality)

Certainly! Let's design an architecture for the Prompt Parser and Chunker using an LLM (in this case, Phi-3) to detect and classify parts of the prompts into different modalities. We'll combine the LLM approach with some pre-processing and post-processing steps to create a robust system. Here's the proposed architecture:

```
+---------------------+
|   Multimodal        |
|   Input Prompt      |
+---------------------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
|   Pre-processor     |
+---------------------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
|   LLM-based         |
|   Modality Detector |
+---------------------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
|   Chunk Separator   |
+---------------------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
|   Post-processor    |
+---------------------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
|   Tagged Chunks     |
+---------------------+
```

Let's break down each component and provide Python-like pseudocode for implementation:

1. Pre-processor:
   - Tokenizes the input prompt
   - Identifies obvious modality markers (e.g., file extensions, URLs)

```python
def preprocess(input_prompt):
    tokens = tokenize(input_prompt)
    obvious_modalities = identify_obvious_modalities(tokens)
    return tokens, obvious_modalities
```

2. LLM-based Modality Detector:
   - Uses Phi-3 to classify each segment of the input into modalities

```python
import lamini

lamini.api_key = "your_api_key_here"
llm = lamini.Lamini("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct")

def detect_modalities(tokens, obvious_modalities):
    system_prompt = """
    You are an AI assistant specialized in detecting modalities in text.
    Given a segment of text, classify it into one of the following modalities:
    text, image, audio, video, or unknown.
    Respond with only the modality label.
    """

    modalities = []
    for i, token in enumerate(tokens):
        if i in obvious_modalities:
            modalities.append(obvious_modalities[i])
        else:
            context = " ".join(tokens[max(0, i-5):min(len(tokens), i+6)])
            prompt = f"Classify the modality of this segment: '{context}'"
            modality = llm.generate(system_prompt + prompt).strip().lower()
            modalities.append(modality)

    return modalities
```

3. Chunk Separator:
   - Groups consecutive tokens with the same modality into chunks

```python
def separate_chunks(tokens, modalities):
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = []
    current_modality = None

    for token, modality in zip(tokens, modalities):
        if modality != current_modality:
            if current_chunk:
                chunks.append((current_modality, " ".join(current_chunk)))
            current_chunk = [token]
            current_modality = modality
        else:
            current_chunk.append(token)

    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append((current_modality, " ".join(current_chunk)))

    return chunks
```

4. Post-processor:
   - Adds modality tags to each chunk
   - Handles edge cases and refines chunk boundaries

```python
def postprocess(chunks):
    tagged_chunks = []
    for modality, content in chunks:
        if modality == "text":
            tagged_chunks.append(f"<text>{content}</text>")
        elif modality == "image":
            tagged_chunks.append(f"<image>{content}</image>")
        elif modality == "audio":
            tagged_chunks.append(f"<audio>{content}</audio>")
        elif modality == "video":
            tagged_chunks.append(f"<video>{content}</video>")
        else:
            tagged_chunks.append(f"<unknown>{content}</unknown>")

    return tagged_chunks
```

5. Main Parser and Chunker:
   - Orchestrates the entire process

```python
def parse_and_chunk(input_prompt):
    tokens, obvious_modalities = preprocess(input_prompt)
    modalities = detect_modalities(tokens, obvious_modalities)
    chunks = separate_chunks(tokens, modalities)
    tagged_chunks = postprocess(chunks)
    return tagged_chunks

# Usage
input_prompt = "Describe this image: [URL]. Now, transcribe this audio: [URL]. Finally, summarize this text."
result = parse_and_chunk(input_prompt)
print(result)
```

This architecture combines rule-based preprocessing with LLM-based modality detection to create a flexible and powerful prompt parser and chunker. The system can handle complex, multimodal inputs and produce tagged chunks ready for further processing by the Global Classifier.

Key advantages of this approach:

1. Flexibility: Can handle a wide range of input formats and modalities.
2. Context-awareness: The LLM can use surrounding context to make better modality classifications.
3. Extensibility: Easy to add new modalities or refine the classification process.
4. Robustness: Combines rule-based and AI-based approaches for better accuracy.

Note that this system may require fine-tuning and optimization based on specific use cases and the performance of the LLM on modality detection tasks. You might also want to implement caching or batching strategies to improve efficiency when processing large volumes of input prompts.

---

    create me another architecture which uses a clustering then a classification models rather than LLM

Certainly! I'll design an alternative architecture that uses clustering followed by classification models instead of an LLM for modality detection. This approach can be more efficient for large-scale processing and doesn't rely on API calls to an external LLM service. Here's the proposed architecture:

```
+---------------------+
|   Multimodal        |
|   Input Prompt      |
+---------------------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
|   Pre-processor     |
+---------------------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
|  Feature Extractor  |
+---------------------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
|  Clustering Model   |
+---------------------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
| Classification Model|
+---------------------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
|   Chunk Separator   |
+---------------------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
|   Post-processor    |
+---------------------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
|   Tagged Chunks     |
+---------------------+
```

Let's break down each component and provide Python-like pseudocode for implementation:

1. Pre-processor:
   - Tokenizes the input prompt
   - Handles basic text normalization

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

def preprocess(input_prompt):
    # Tokenize the input
    tokens = word_tokenize(input_prompt)
    # Normalize text (lowercase, remove punctuation, etc.)
    normalized_tokens = [token.lower() for token in tokens if token.isalnum()]
    return normalized_tokens
```

2. Feature Extractor:
   - Extracts relevant features from the tokens for clustering and classification

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

def extract_features(tokens):
    # Join tokens back into sentences for TF-IDF
    sentences = [' '.join(tokens[i:i+10]) for i in range(0, len(tokens), 5)]  # Overlapping windows

    # Create TF-IDF features
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)
    features = vectorizer.fit_transform(sentences)

    return features, vectorizer
```

3. Clustering Model:
   - Groups similar tokens/segments together

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

def cluster_segments(features):
    # Perform K-means clustering
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4)  # Assuming 4 modalities: text, image, audio, video
    cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(features)

    return cluster_labels
```

4. Classification Model:
   - Assigns modality labels to the clusters

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def train_classifier(features, cluster_labels):
    # Assume we have some labeled data for training
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, cluster_labels, test_size=0.2)

    # Train a Random Forest classifier
    classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
    classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

    return classifier

def classify_clusters(features, classifier):
    # Predict modalities for each segment
    modalities = classifier.predict(features)

    return modalities
```

5. Chunk Separator:
   - Groups consecutive tokens with the same modality into chunks

```python
def separate_chunks(tokens, modalities):
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = []
    current_modality = None

    for token, modality in zip(tokens, modalities):
        if modality != current_modality:
            if current_chunk:
                chunks.append((current_modality, " ".join(current_chunk)))
            current_chunk = [token]
            current_modality = modality
        else:
            current_chunk.append(token)

    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append((current_modality, " ".join(current_chunk)))

    return chunks
```

6. Post-processor:
   - Adds modality tags to each chunk
   - Handles edge cases and refines chunk boundaries

```python
def postprocess(chunks):
    modality_map = {0: "text", 1: "image", 2: "audio", 3: "video"}
    tagged_chunks = []

    for modality, content in chunks:
        mod_name = modality_map.get(modality, "unknown")
        tagged_chunks.append(f"<{mod_name}>{content}</{mod_name}>")

    return tagged_chunks
```

7. Main Parser and Chunker:
   - Orchestrates the entire process

```python
def parse_and_chunk(input_prompt, trained_classifier, vectorizer):
    tokens = preprocess(input_prompt)
    features, _ = extract_features(tokens)
    cluster_labels = cluster_segments(features)
    modalities = classify_clusters(features, trained_classifier)
    chunks = separate_chunks(tokens, modalities)
    tagged_chunks = postprocess(chunks)
    return tagged_chunks

# Usage
# First, train the classifier (this would be done offline with a labeled dataset)
labeled_data = load_labeled_data()  # You'd need to implement this
features, vectorizer = extract_features(labeled_data.tokens)
cluster_labels = cluster_segments(features)
trained_classifier = train_classifier(features, cluster_labels)

# Now use the trained classifier for parsing and chunking
input_prompt = "Describe this image: [URL]. Now, transcribe this audio: [URL]. Finally, summarize this text."
result = parse_and_chunk(input_prompt, trained_classifier, vectorizer)
print(result)
```

This architecture offers several advantages:

1. Scalability: Once trained, the clustering and classification models can process inputs quickly without needing to make API calls.
2. Customizability: You can fine-tune the models on your specific dataset to improve accuracy for your use case.
3. Offline capability: The system can work without an internet connection once the models are trained.
4. Interpretability: The clustering step provides insights into how the system groups similar content.

Considerations:

- This approach requires a labeled dataset for training the classifier. You'd need to create or obtain such a dataset.
- The performance heavily depends on the quality and representativeness of the training data.
- You may need to periodically retrain the models to adapt to changing input patterns.
- The feature extraction step is crucial; you might need to experiment with different feature engineering techniques for optimal performance.

This architecture provides a robust, scalable alternative to the LLM-based approach for parsing and chunking multimodal input prompts.

---

    now create an architecture which perform a two step prompts decomposition uses both methods for more guaranteed result (leverages from the good of both worlds)

Excellent idea! Let's create a hybrid architecture that combines both the LLM-based approach and the clustering/classification approach for a more robust and accurate prompt decomposition. This two-step process will leverage the strengths of both methods to provide more reliable results. Here's the proposed architecture:

```

                +-------------------------+
                |     Tagged Chunks       |
                +-------------------------+
```

Let's break down the components and provide Python-like pseudocode for this hybrid approach:

1. Pre-processor:

```python
def preprocess(input_prompt):
    tokens = tokenize(input_prompt)
    normalized_tokens = normalize(tokens)
    return tokens, normalized_tokens
```

2. LLM-based Path:

```python
import lamini

lamini.api_key = "your_api_key_here"
llm = lamini.Lamini("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct")

def llm_modality_detection(tokens):
    system_prompt = """
    You are an AI assistant specialized in detecting modalities in text.
    Given a segment of text, classify it into one of the following modalities:
    text, image, audio, video, or unknown.
    Respond with only the modality label.
    """

    modalities = []
    for i in range(0, len(tokens), 10):  # Process in chunks of 10 tokens
        chunk = " ".join(tokens[i:i+10])
        prompt = f"Classify the modality of this segment: '{chunk}'"
        modality = llm.generate(system_prompt + prompt).strip().lower()
        modalities.extend([modality] * min(10, len(tokens) - i))

    return modalities
```

3. ML-based Path:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

def ml_modality_detection(normalized_tokens):
    # Feature Extraction
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)
    features = vectorizer.fit_transform(normalized_tokens)

    # Clustering
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4)
    cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(features)

    # Classification
    classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
    # Assume we have some labeled data for training
    classifier.fit(features, cluster_labels)

    modalities = classifier.predict(features)
    return modalities
```

4. Results Aggregator and Conflict Resolver:

```python
def aggregate_and_resolve(llm_modalities, ml_modalities):
    aggregated_modalities = []
    for llm_mod, ml_mod in zip(llm_modalities, ml_modalities):
        if llm_mod == ml_mod:
            aggregated_modalities.append(llm_mod)
        else:
            # In case of conflict, prefer LLM result but mark as uncertain
            aggregated_modalities.append(f"uncertain_{llm_mod}")
    return aggregated_modalities
```

5. Chunk Separator:

```python
def separate_chunks(tokens, modalities):
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = []
    current_modality = None

    for token, modality in zip(tokens, modalities):
        if modality != current_modality:
            if current_chunk:
                chunks.append((current_modality, " ".join(current_chunk)))
            current_chunk = [token]
            current_modality = modality
        else:
            current_chunk.append(token)

    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append((current_modality, " ".join(current_chunk)))

    return chunks
```

6. Post-processor:

```python
def postprocess(chunks):
    tagged_chunks = []
    for modality, content in chunks:
        if modality.startswith("uncertain_"):
            mod = modality.split("_")[1]
            tagged_chunks.append(f"<{mod} uncertain=\"true\">{content}</{mod}>")
        else:
            tagged_chunks.append(f"<{modality}>{content}</{modality}>")
    return tagged_chunks
```

7. Main Hybrid Parser and Chunker:

```python
def hybrid_parse_and_chunk(input_prompt):
    tokens, normalized_tokens = preprocess(input_prompt)

    # Run both paths in parallel (for simplicity, we'll do it sequentially here)
    llm_modalities = llm_modality_detection(tokens)
    ml_modalities = ml_modality_detection(normalized_tokens)

    # Aggregate and resolve conflicts
    final_modalities = aggregate_and_resolve(llm_modalities, ml_modalities)

    # Separate into chunks
    chunks = separate_chunks(tokens, final_modalities)

    # Post-process and add tags
    tagged_chunks = postprocess(chunks)

    return tagged_chunks

# Usage
input_prompt = "Describe this image: [URL]. Now, transcribe this audio: [URL]. Finally, summarize this text."
result = hybrid_parse_and_chunk(input_prompt)
print(result)
```

This hybrid architecture offers several advantages:

1. Robustness: By combining two different approaches, it's less likely to miss important modality switches or misclassify chunks.

2. Confidence Levels: The system can mark chunks where the two methods disagree as "uncertain," allowing for special handling or human review of these cases.

3. Flexibility: You can adjust the weight given to each method in the conflict resolution step based on their performance in your specific use case.

4. Comprehensive Analysis: The LLM provides context-aware analysis, while the ML approach offers consistent pattern recognition.

5. Scalability: The ML-based path can handle large volumes of data quickly, while the LLM path can be used for more nuanced or ambiguous cases.

6. Continuous Improvement: You can fine-tune both the LLM prompts and the ML models over time based on performance.

Considerations for Implementation:

- Parallelization: In a production environment, you'd want to run the LLM and ML paths in parallel to reduce processing time.
- Caching: Implement caching for LLM results to avoid repeated API calls for similar inputs.
- Adaptive Weighting: Develop a system to dynamically adjust the weighting between LLM and ML results based on their historical accuracy.
- Feedback Loop: Incorporate a mechanism to learn from corrections or confirmations of the system's output to improve both paths over time.

This hybrid approach provides a robust, flexible, and accurate method for decomposing multimodal input prompts, leveraging the strengths of both LLM-based and traditional ML-based

---

    now comes the next stage ,
    given those  prompt parts with specific modality tags or signal we feed them to the global classifier which perform a first level prompt classification into
    - text-to-image
    - text-to-audio
    - text-to-video
    - text-to-text
    - image-to-text
    - audio-to-text
    - video-to-text

    and then passed to another rectification unit which verify based on the context of the partial prompt if the modality given by the classifier is correct or give percentage of correctness

    ```
    Global Classifier:

        This component analyzes the input prompt and classifies it into different modalities (image, audio, text, video).
        It determines which specific sub-classifiers and processing units to activate.

    Prompt Rectification Unit:

        This stage likely refines or adjusts the input based on the global classification

```

Certainly! Let's design the Global Classifier and the Prompt Rectification Unit to handle the classified prompt parts. This system will take the tagged chunks from the previous stage and perform a higher-level classification, followed by a verification step.

Here's the proposed architecture for this stage:

```

    +---------------------------+
    | Tagged Prompt Chunks      |
    +---------------------------+
                |
                v
    +---------------------------+
    | Global Classifier         |
    +---------------------------+
                |
                v
    +---------------------------+
    | Prompt Rectification Unit |
    +---------------------------+
                |
                v
    +---------------------------+
    | Refined Classification    |
    +---------------------------+

````

Let's break down each component:

1. Global Classifier:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
import numpy as np

class GlobalClassifier:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)
        self.classifier = OneVsRestClassifier(SVC(kernel='linear', probability=True))
        self.classes = [
            'text-to-image', 'text-to-audio', 'text-to-video', 'text-to-text',
            'image-to-text', 'audio-to-text', 'video-to-text'
        ]

    def train(self, X, y):
        X_vectorized = self.vectorizer.fit_transform(X)
        self.classifier.fit(X_vectorized, y)

    def predict(self, tagged_chunks):
        # Combine all chunks into a single string
        full_prompt = ' '.join([chunk for _, chunk in tagged_chunks])
        X_vectorized = self.vectorizer.transform([full_prompt])
        probabilities = self.classifier.predict_proba(X_vectorized)[0]
        predicted_class = self.classes[np.argmax(probabilities)]
        return predicted_class, dict(zip(self.classes, probabilities))

# Usage
classifier = GlobalClassifier()
# Train the classifier (you'd need a labeled dataset for this)
# classifier.train(X_train, y_train)

tagged_chunks = [
    ('<text>', 'Generate an image of'),
    ('<image>', '[URL]'),
    ('<text>', 'with the following description:'),
    ('<text>', 'A serene lake surrounded by mountains at sunset.')
]

predicted_class, class_probabilities = classifier.predict(tagged_chunks)
print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class}")
print(f"Class probabilities: {class_probabilities}")
````

2. Prompt Rectification Unit:

```python
import re

class PromptRectificationUnit:
    def __init__(self):
        self.modality_patterns = {
            'text-to-image': r'(generate|create|make|draw).*(image|picture|photo)',
            'text-to-audio': r'(generate|create|make).*(audio|sound|music)',
            'text-to-video': r'(generate|create|make).*(video|movie|clip)',
            'text-to-text': r'(write|compose|generate).*(text|story|article)',
            'image-to-text': r'(describe|explain|analyze).*(image|picture|photo)',
            'audio-to-text': r'(transcribe|describe).*(audio|sound|music)',
            'video-to-text': r'(describe|summarize).*(video|movie|clip)'
        }

    def rectify(self, predicted_class, class_probabilities, tagged_chunks):
        full_prompt = ' '.join([chunk for _, chunk in tagged_chunks])

        # Check if the predicted class pattern is in the prompt
        if re.search(self.modality_patterns[predicted_class], full_prompt, re.IGNORECASE):
            confidence = 1.0
        else:
            # If not, find the best matching pattern
            matching_classes = [
                cls for cls, pattern in self.modality_patterns.items()
                if re.search(pattern, full_prompt, re.IGNORECASE)
            ]

            if matching_classes:
                best_match = max(matching_classes, key=lambda cls: class_probabilities[cls])
                predicted_class = best_match
                confidence = class_probabilities[best_match]
            else:
                # If no pattern matches, keep the original prediction but with lower confidence
                confidence = class_probabilities[predicted_class] * 0.5

        return predicted_class, confidence

# Usage
rectifier = PromptRectificationUnit()
rectified_class, confidence = rectifier.rectify(predicted_class, class_probabilities, tagged_chunks)
print(f"Rectified class: {rectified_class}")
print(f"Confidence: {confidence}")
```

3. Main Pipeline:

```python
def process_prompt(tagged_chunks):
    # Global Classification
    global_classifier = GlobalClassifier()
    predicted_class, class_probabilities = global_classifier.predict(tagged_chunks)

    # Prompt Rectification
    rectifier = PromptRectificationUnit()
    rectified_class, confidence = rectifier.rectify(predicted_class, class_probabilities, tagged_chunks)

    return {
        'original_classification': predicted_class,
        'rectified_classification': rectified_class,
        'confidence': confidence,
        'class_probabilities': class_probabilities
    }

# Example usage
tagged_chunks = [
    ('<text>', 'Generate an image of'),
    ('<image>', '[URL]'),
    ('<text>', 'with the following description:'),
    ('<text>', 'A serene lake surrounded by mountains at sunset.')
]

result = process_prompt(tagged_chunks)
print(result)
```

This system works as follows:

1. The Global Classifier uses a machine learning model (in this case, a One-vs-Rest SVM classifier with TF-IDF features) to classify the entire prompt into one of the seven categories. It returns both the predicted class and the probabilities for each class.

2. The Prompt Rectification Unit then takes this classification and performs a rule-based check using regular expressions to verify if the predicted class matches the content of the prompt. If it doesn't, it tries to find a better matching class or adjusts the confidence score.

3. The main pipeline combines these steps and returns a comprehensive result including the original classification, the rectified classification, the confidence score, and the probabilities for all classes.

Key features of this system:

1. Multi-class Classification: The Global Classifier can handle multiple input-output modality combinations.
2. Probability-based: It provides probabilities for each class, allowing for more nuanced decision-making.
3. Content Verification: The Rectification Unit checks the actual content of the prompt against expected patterns for each class.
4. Confidence Scoring: The system provides a confidence score for its final classification.

To improve this system:

1. Train the Global Classifier on a large, diverse dataset of prompts.
2. Refine the regular expressions in the Rectification Unit based on common patterns in your specific use case.
3. Consider adding more features to the classifier, such as the presence and count of different modality tags.
4. Implement a feedback loop to continuously improve both the classifier and the rectification rules based on actual usage.

This two-stage approach combines the strengths of machine learning-based classification with rule-based verification, providing a robust system for classifying and verifying multimodal prompts.

    isn't the LLM based verification or rectification better for contextual inferring? rather than mere regex here or why not use both units
    The Prompt Rectification Unit then takes this classification and performs a rule-based check using regular expressions to verify if the predicted class matches the content of the prompt. If it doesn't, it tries to find a better matching class or adjusts the confidence score.

You're absolutely right, and I appreciate you pointing that out. Using an LLM for verification and rectification would indeed be better for contextual inferring, as it can understand nuances and implicit meanings that regex patterns might miss. A hybrid approach using both LLM and rule-based verification could provide even more robust results. Let's revise the Prompt Rectification Unit to incorporate an LLM-based approach alongside the rule-based checks.

Here's an updated version of the Prompt Rectification Unit:

```python
import re
import lamini

lamini.api_key = "your_api_key_here"
llm = lamini.Lamini("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct")

class PromptRectificationUnit:
    def __init__(self):
        self.modality_patterns = {
            'text-to-image': r'(generate|create|make|draw).*(image|picture|photo)',
            'text-to-audio': r'(generate|create|make).*(audio|sound|music)',
            'text-to-video': r'(generate|create|make).*(video|movie|clip)',
            'text-to-text': r'(write|compose|generate).*(text|story|article)',
            'image-to-text': r'(describe|explain|analyze).*(image|picture|photo)',
            'audio-to-text': r'(transcribe|describe).*(audio|sound|music)',
            'video-to-text': r'(describe|summarize).*(video|movie|clip)'
        }

    def rule_based_check(self, predicted_class, full_prompt):
        if re.search(self.modality_patterns[predicted_class], full_prompt, re.IGNORECASE):
            return True
        return False

    def llm_based_check(self, predicted_class, full_prompt):
        system_prompt = """
        You are an AI assistant specialized in analyzing prompts and determining their modality.
        Given a prompt and a predicted modality, your task is to verify if the prediction is correct.

        Also provide a brief explanation for your decision.
        """

        user_prompt = f"""
        Prompt: {full_prompt}
        Predicted modality: {predicted_class}
        Is this prediction correct?
        """

        response = llm.generate(system_prompt + user_prompt)
        is_correct = response.strip().lower().startswith('true')
        explanation = response.split('\n', 1)[1] if '\n' in response else ''

        return is_correct, explanation

    def rectify(self, predicted_class, class_probabilities, tagged_chunks):
        full_prompt = ' '.join([chunk for _, chunk in tagged_chunks])

        # Rule-based check
        rule_based_correct = self.rule_based_check(predicted_class, full_prompt)

        # LLM-based check
        llm_based_correct, explanation = self.llm_based_check(predicted_class, full_prompt)

        if rule_based_correct and llm_based_correct:
            confidence = 1.0
        elif rule_based_correct or llm_based_correct:
            confidence = 0.8
        else:
            # If both checks fail, find the best alternative
            alternative_classes = [
                cls for cls in class_probabilities.keys()
                if cls != predicted_class and (
                    self.rule_based_check(cls, full_prompt) or
                    self.llm_based_check(cls, full_prompt)[0]
                )
            ]

            if alternative_classes:
                predicted_class = max(alternative_classes, key=lambda cls: class_probabilities[cls])
                confidence = class_probabilities[predicted_class] * 0.9
            else:
                # If no good alternative, keep original but with low confidence
                confidence = class_probabilities[predicted_class] * 0.5

        return predicted_class, confidence, explanation

# Usage
rectifier = PromptRectificationUnit()
rectified_class, confidence, explanation = rectifier.rectify(predicted_class, class_probabilities, tagged_chunks)
print(f"Rectified class: {rectified_class}")
print(f"Confidence: {confidence}")
print(f"Explanation: {explanation}")
```

This updated version of the Prompt Rectification Unit incorporates both rule-based and LLM-based checks:

1. Rule-based check: Uses regex patterns to quickly check if the predicted class matches common patterns in the prompt.

2. LLM-based check: Uses an LLM to perform a more nuanced, context-aware verification of the predicted class.

3. Combined decision-making:

   - If both checks agree, we have high confidence in the prediction.
   - If only one check passes, we still accept the prediction but with slightly lower confidence.
   - If both checks fail, we look for alternative classifications that pass either check.
   - If no good alternatives are found, we keep the original prediction but with low confidence.

4. The LLM also provides an explanation for its decision, which can be useful for understanding the reasoning behind the classification.

Benefits of this hybrid approach:

1. Contextual Understanding: The LLM can catch nuanced or implicit instructions that regex patterns might miss.

2. Robustness: By combining rule-based and LLM-based checks, we reduce the risk of errors from either method alone.

3. Explanability: The LLM provides reasoning for its decision, which can be valuable for debugging or user understanding.

4. Flexibility: The system can handle a wide range of prompt structures and phrasings.

5. Speed: The rule-based check can quickly handle common cases, while the LLM provides deeper analysis when needed.

To use this updated system, you would integrate it into the main pipeline like this:

```python
def process_prompt(tagged_chunks):
    # Global Classification
    global_classifier = GlobalClassifier()
    predicted_class, class_probabilities = global_classifier.predict(tagged_chunks)

    # Prompt Rectification
    rectifier = PromptRectificationUnit()
    rectified_class, confidence, explanation = rectifier.rectify(predicted_class, class_probabilities, tagged_chunks)

    return {
        'original_classification': predicted_class,
        'rectified_classification': rectified_class,
        'confidence': confidence,
        'explanation': explanation,
        'class_probabilities': class_probabilities
    }

# Example usage
tagged_chunks = [
    ('<text>', 'Generate an image of'),
    ('<image>', '[URL]'),
    ('<text>', 'with the following description:'),
    ('<text>', 'A serene lake surrounded by mountains at sunset.')
]

result = process_prompt(tagged_chunks)
print(result)
```

This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both rule-based and LLM-based methods, providing a more robust and context-aware system for verifying and rectifying prompt classifications.

---

    why not just use the LLM with system prompts, redraw architecture based on that approach

You're absolutely right. Using an LLM with well-crafted system prompts can indeed be a more elegant and powerful solution for this task. Let's redesign the architecture to focus on leveraging the LLM's capabilities for both classification and verification. This approach will provide better context understanding and flexibility.

Here's the revised architecture:

```
+---------------------------+
|    Tagged Prompt Chunks   |
+---------------------------+
              |
              v

| LLM-based Verifier        |
+---------------------------+
              |
              v

Let's implement this new architecture:

            "confidence": 0.95,
            "explanation": "The prompt clearly asks to generate an image based on a textual description.",
            "suggested_class": None
        }
        return parsed_response

    def process(self, tagged_chunks):
        # Convert tagged chunks to a string representation
        chunks_str = "\n".join([f"{tag}: {content}" for tag, content in tagged_chunks])

        # Classify
        predicted_class = self.classify(chunks_str)

        # Verify
        verification_result = self.verify(predicted_class, chunks_str)

        # Determine final classification
        final_class = verification_result["suggested_class"] if verification_result["suggested_class"] else predicted_class

        return {
            "original_classification": predicted_class,
            "final_classification": final_class,

            "explanation": verification_result["explanation"],
            "is_original_correct": verification_result["is_correct"]
        }

# Usage
processor = LLMPromptProcessor()

tagged_chunks = [
    ('<text>', 'Generate an image of'),
    ('<image>', '[URL]'),
    ('<text>', 'with the following description:'),
    ('<text>', 'A serene lake surrounded by mountains at sunset.')
]

result = processor.process(tagged_chunks)
print(result)
```

This revised architecture offers several advantages:

1. Unified Approach: By using the LLM for both classification and verification, we ensure a consistent understanding of the prompt's context.

2. Flexibility: The LLM can handle a wide variety of prompt structures and phrasings without needing predefined rules or patterns.

3. Contextual Understanding: The LLM can capture nuances and implicit instructions that might be missed by rule-based systems.

4. Explanability: The verification step provides an explanation for the classification, which is valuable for understanding the reasoning and potentially improving the system.

5. Confidence Scoring: The LLM provides a confidence score, allowing for more nuanced decision-making downstream.

6. Adaptability: By adjusting the system prompts, you can easily modify the behavior of the classifier and verifier without changing the underlying code.

7. Simplicity: The architecture is straightforward, with fewer components and potential points of failure.

To further improve this system:

1. Fine-tune the LLM on a dataset of multimodal prompts to improve its performance on this specific task.

2. Implement proper JSON parsing for the verification response.

3. Add error handling for cases where the LLM response doesn't match the expected format.

4. Consider adding a caching layer to improve performance for frequently seen prompts.

5. Implement a feedback loop to continuously improve the system prompts based on real-world usage and edge cases.

This LLM-centric approach provides a powerful and flexible solution for classifying and verifying multimodal prompts, leveraging the advanced language understanding capabilities of large language models.

    This image presents a detailed architecture for a multimodal system designed to process and generate content across various modalities. Let's break down the system's components and integration pipeline:
    ....
    TASK: now based on the same approach design the sub classifiers and their correcter (prompt class rectifier)

Certainly. Let's design the sub-classifiers and their corrector (prompt class rectifier) using the same LLM-based approach. This design will allow for more nuanced classification within each modality and provide a mechanism for refining and correcting these classifications.

Here's the proposed architecture for the sub-classifiers and prompt class rectifier:

```

This implementation offers several advantages:

1. Modality-specific sub-classification: Each modality has its own set of sub-classes, allowing for more precise categorization.

2. Flexible and extensible: New modalities and sub-classes can be easily added by updating the `sub_classes` dictionary.

3. Context-aware rectification: The PromptClassRectifier takes into account the global classification, sub-classification, and the full prompt to make informed decisions.

4. Rich output: The system provides not just a classification, but also confidence scores, explanations, and additional context that can be valuable for downstream tasks.

5. Consistency with global classifier: By using the same LLM-based approach, we ensure consistency in how prompts are interpreted across different levels of classification.

6. Adaptability: The system prompts can be easily modified to adjust the behavior of the sub-classifiers and rectifier without changing the underlying code.

To further improve this system:

1. Implement proper JSON parsing for the rectifier response.

2. Add error handling for cases where the LLM response doesn't match the expected format.

3. Consider adding examples in the system prompts to guide the LLM's responses, especially for edge cases.

4. Implement a feedback loop to continuously improve the system prompts based on real-world usage.

5. Consider fine-tuning the LLM on a dataset of modality-specific prompts to improve its performance on these specific tasks.

6. Implement caching to improve performance for frequently seen prompts or sub-classifications.

This LLM-based approach for sub-classification and rectification provides a powerful and flexible solution that can handle the nuances of different modalities while maintaining consistency with the global classification system.

    now create the integration with the general classifier pipeline

Certainly. Let's integrate the sub-classification and rectification process with the general classifier pipeline. This integration will create a comprehensive system that handles the entire classification process from the initial prompt to the final, refined sub-classification.

Here's the integrated pipeline:

This integrated pipeline offers several advantages:

1. End-to-end processing: The system handles the entire classification process from initial prompt to final sub-classification in a single, coherent pipeline.

2. Hierarchical classification: The global classification informs the sub-classification process, ensuring consistency and allowing for more nuanced categorization.

3. Multi-level verification: Both the global classification and sub-classification are verified and potentially corrected, improving overall accuracy.

4. Rich output: The final result includes detailed information about both the global and sub-classification processes, including confidence scores, explanations, and additional context.

5. Flexibility: The LLM-based approach allows for easy adaptation to new modalities or sub-categories by updating the system prompts.

6. Consistency: Using the same LLM throughout the pipeline ensures a consistent understanding and interpretation of the prompt at all stages.

To further improve this integrated system:

1. Implement proper JSON parsing for all LLM responses.

2. Add error handling and fallback mechanisms for cases where the LLM responses don't match the expected format.

3. Consider adding a caching layer to improve performance for frequently seen prompts or classifications.

4. Implement a feedback loop to continuously improve the system prompts based on real-world usage and edge cases.

5. Consider fine-tuning the LLM on a dataset of multimodal prompts to improve its performance on these specific tasks.

    now we are going to create the integration part with the diffusers and llms like this
    ....

I'd be happy to help you create the integration part with diffusers and language models. Let's go through the code and discuss how to implement it.

This code appears to be a complex function that handles various tasks related to text, image, and audio processing using different AI models and workflows. It's using libraries like Gradio, Langchain, Ollama, and Stable Diffusion for different functionalities.

Here are some key points about the integration:

1. The function takes many parameters to configure the behavior of different workflows and models.

2. It uses environment variables to set API keys for services like Google.

3. The code is organized into different workflows: text2audio, audio2text, image2text, text2image, and text2text.

4. For image generation tasks, it's using the Stable Diffusion model from the `diffusers` library.

5. For text generation tasks, it's using either Ollama models or Google's generative AI models.

6. The function uses a match-case structure to handle different workflows and tasks within each workflow.

To implement this integration, you'll need to:

1. Install the required libraries (diffusers, transformers, torch, langchain, gradio, ollama, etc.)

2. Set up the necessary API keys and environment variables.

3. Implement the individual components for each workflow (text-to-speech, speech-to-text, image generation, text generation, etc.)

4. Ensure you have the required models downloaded or accessible (e.g., Stable Diffusion models for image generation)

5. Implement proper error handling and user feedback (the code uses Gradio's error and info messages)

6. Set up the streaming functionality for text generation tasks

7. Implement file handling for saving and loading images, audio files, etc.

    i meant to use the same principle for calling the LLMs and diffusers with match statement for the multi modality content generation but the workflow and the task is now detected by the previously designed system of classifiers and rectifiers, hence the automatic smart multi modal content generation , create me the integration part architecture between the prompt classification logic and content generation logic (or the joint logic)

I understand now. You want to create an integration architecture that combines the prompt classification logic with the content generation logic, using a similar principle of match statements for multi-modal content generation. This approach will allow for automatic, smart multi-modal content generation based on the classified workflow and task. Let's design this integration architecture:

```python
from typing import Dict, Any, List, Tuple
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, AIMessage
import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
from PIL import Image
import io
import base64
import os

# Assume these are imported or defined elsewhere
from classifier import classify_prompt
from rectifier import rectify_task
from llm_handlers import handle_text_generation
from image_handlers import handle_image_generation
from audio_handlers import handle_audio_generation
from video_handlers import handle_video_generation

def smart_multi_modal_content_generation(
    prompt: str,
    history: List[List[str]],
    config: Dict[str, Any]
) -> Tuple[Any, str]:
    # Step 1: Classify the prompt
    workflow, confidence = classify_prompt(prompt)

    # Step 2: Rectify the task if needed
    task = rectify_task(workflow, prompt)

    # Step 3: Prepare the context
    context = prepare_context(history, config)

    # Step 4: Generate content based on workflow and task
    content, explanation = generate_content(workflow, task, prompt, context, config)

    return content, explanation

def prepare_context(history: List[List[str]], config: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    context = {
        "history": [
            (HumanMessage(content=human), AIMessage(content=ai))
            for human, ai in history
        ],
        "config": config
    }
    return context

def generate_content(
    workflow: str,
    task: str,
    prompt: str,
    context: Dict[str, Any],
    config: Dict[str, Any]
) -> Tuple[Any, str]:
    match workflow:
        case "text2text":
            return handle_text_generation(task, prompt, context, config)

        case "text2image":
            return handle_image_generation(task, prompt, context, config)

        case "text2audio":
            return handle_audio_generation(task, prompt, context, config)

        case "text2video":
            return handle_video_generation(task, prompt, context, config)

        case _:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported workflow: {workflow}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    prompt = "Create a serene landscape image with a calm lake and mountains"
    history = []
    config = {
        "api_key": os.getenv("API_KEY"),
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "max_tokens": 150,
        "image_size": (512, 512),
        "num_inference_steps": 50,
        "guidance_scale": 7.5,
    }

    content, explanation = smart_multi_modal_content_generation(prompt, history, config)
    print(f"Generated content: {type(content)}")
    print(f"Explanation: {explanation}")
```

This architecture does the following:

1. The main function `smart_multi_modal_content_generation` takes a prompt, conversation history, and configuration as input.

2. It first classifies the prompt to determine the workflow.

3. It then rectifies the task within the determined workflow.

4. The context is prepared, including the conversation history and configuration.

5. Based on the workflow, it calls the appropriate content generation function using a match statement.

6. Each content generation function (text, image, audio, video) is handled by a separate module, allowing for easy extensibility and maintenance.

7. The function returns the generated content and an explanation.

To implement this:

1. Create separate modules for each type of content generation (text, image, audio, video).
2. Implement the classifier and rectifier modules.
3. Ensure that each content generation module can handle various tasks within its domain.
4. Use appropriate models and APIs within each module (e.g., LLMs for text, Stable Diffusion for images).
5. Implement proper error handling and logging.
6. Ensure that the configuration can be easily updated to change model parameters, API keys, etc.

This architecture allows for easy addition of new workflows and tasks, and provides a unified interface for multi-modal content generation based on prompt classification.

    now create the architecture for the last unit of the project which is multi-modality output alignment with the llm generated text and the different modalities (voice , image)
    propose a solution for that

Certainly. For the multi-modality output alignment unit, we want to ensure that the generated text, images, and voice are coherent and aligned with each other. This unit will take the outputs from various modalities and align them to create a cohesive final product. Here's a proposed architecture for this alignment unit:

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

This architecture does the following:

1. We define a `MultiModalAligner` class that handles the alignment of text, image, and audio outputs.

2. The class uses pre-trained models:

   - CLIP for text and image feature extraction
   - SpeechBrain for audio feature extraction

3. The `align_outputs` method extracts features from each modality and computes similarities between them.

4. The `align_multi_modal_output` function uses the `MultiModalAligner` to determine if the outputs are aligned based on a similarity threshold.

5. Similarities are computed using cosine similarity between feature vectors.

To implement and improve this system:

1. Fine-tune the pre-trained models on your specific domain if necessary.

2. Implement more sophisticated alignment metrics, possibly incorporating semantic understanding.

3. Add a feedback loop to the content generation process, allowing for refinement of outputs that are not well-aligned.

4. Implement a more robust audio feature extraction method, possibly using a model specifically trained for speech-to-text alignment.

5. Consider adding additional modalities or sub-modalities (e.g., style consistency for images, emotion consistency for audio).

6. Implement caching of model outputs to improve performance for repeated alignments.

7. Add error handling and logging for robustness.

8. Consider implementing a more sophisticated alignment algorithm that can suggest specific improvements to bring the modalities into better alignment.

This architecture provides a foundation for aligning multi-modal outputs, ensuring that the generated content across different modalities is coherent and consistent with the original prompt and intent.

    create me a full documentation on the alignment logic and design choices yoou've taken

Certainly. Here's a comprehensive documentation on the alignment logic and design choices for the multi-modality output alignment unit:

# Multi-Modality Output Alignment Documentation

## 1. Introduction

The multi-modality output alignment unit is designed to ensure coherence and consistency across different modalities of generated content (text, image, and audio) in response to a given prompt. This unit is crucial for maintaining the quality and relevance of multi-modal content generation systems.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The alignment system is built around the `MultiModalAligner` class, which utilizes pre-trained models to extract features from different modalities and compute similarities between them. The main function `align_multi_modal_output` serves as the entry point for the alignment process.

## 3. Components

### 3.1 MultiModalAligner Class

This class is the core of the alignment system. It initializes and manages the following components:

- CLIP model for text and image feature extraction
- CLIP processor for preparing inputs
- SpeechBrain EncoderClassifier for audio feature extraction

#### Methods:

- `align_outputs`: Orchestrates the alignment process
- `_extract_text_features`: Extracts features from text input
- `_extract_image_features`: Extracts features from image input
- `_extract_audio_features`: Extracts features from audio input
- `_compute_similarity`: Calculates cosine similarity between feature vectors

### 3.2 align_multi_modal_output Function

This function serves as the main interface for the alignment process. It creates an instance of `MultiModalAligner`, computes similarities, and determines if the outputs are aligned based on a threshold.

## 4. Alignment Process

1. Feature Extraction: Extract features from text, image, and audio inputs using pre-trained models.
2. Similarity Computation: Calculate cosine similarities between features of different modalities.
3. Alignment Determination: Compare similarities against a threshold to determine if outputs are aligned.

## 5. Design Choices and Rationale

### 5.1 Use of Pre-trained Models

- **CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)**: Chosen for its ability to understand both text and images in a shared semantic space. This allows for direct comparison between text and image features.
- **SpeechBrain EncoderClassifier**: Selected for audio feature extraction due to its robustness in speaker recognition tasks, which can capture important audio characteristics.

Rationale: Pre-trained models provide a strong foundation for feature extraction without requiring extensive domain-specific training.

### 5.2 Cosine Similarity Metric

Cosine similarity is used to measure the alignment between different modalities.

Rationale: Cosine similarity is scale-invariant and works well for high-dimensional spaces, making it suitable for comparing feature vectors from different modalities.

### 5.3 Modular Design

The system is designed with separate methods for feature extraction and similarity computation.

Rationale: This modular approach allows for easy updates or replacements of individual components without affecting the overall system.

### 5.4 Threshold-based Alignment Determination

A simple threshold is used to determine if outputs are aligned.

Rationale: This provides a clear, interpretable decision boundary. However, it's a simplification and may be refined in future iterations.

## 6. Limitations and Future Improvements

### 6.1 Current Limitations

- The audio feature extraction might not capture semantic content effectively.
- The threshold-based alignment determination is relatively simplistic.
- The system doesn't provide specific feedback on how to improve alignment.

### 6.2 Proposed Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Audio Processing**: Implement a more sophisticated audio understanding model, possibly incorporating speech-to-text for semantic analysis.

2. **Semantic Alignment**: Develop more nuanced alignment metrics that consider semantic meaning across modalities.

3. **Feedback Loop**: Implement a system that can suggest specific improvements to bring modalities into better alignment.

4. **Fine-tuning**: Allow for fine-tuning of pre-trained models on domain-specific data to improve relevance.

5. **Dynamic Thresholding**: Implement adaptive thresholds based on the specific content or context.

6. **Additional Modalities**: Extend the system to handle other modalities like video or interactive elements.

7. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching and batch processing to improve efficiency for large-scale applications.

## 7. Usage Guidelines

1. Ensure all required models and libraries are installed and accessible.
2. Prepare inputs in the correct format (string for text, PIL Image for images, numpy array for audio).
3. Call `align_multi_modal_output` with your inputs and desired threshold.
4. Interpret the results:
   - `is_aligned` indicates overall alignment status
   - `similarities` provides detailed similarity scores between modalities

## 8. Conclusion

The multi-modality output alignment unit provides a foundation for ensuring coherence across different content modalities. While the current implementation offers a solid starting point, there is significant room for enhancement and refinement to handle more complex alignment scenarios and provide more nuanced feedback.

Rationale: This provides flexibility in adjusting system behavior without changing the code, and allows for easy integration with user interfaces or configuration files.

## 6. Extensibility

### 6.1 Adding New Workflows

To add a new workflow:

1. Update the `classify_prompt` function to recognize the new workflow.
2. Add a new case to the match statement in `generate_content`.
3. Implement a new handler function for the workflow.

### 6.2 Enhancing Existing Workflows

Existing workflows can be enhanced by updating their respective handler functions. This can include integrating new models, adding new features, or improving output quality.

## 7. Error Handling and Logging

While not explicitly shown in the provided code, it's crucial to implement robust error handling and logging throughout the system. This includes:

- Handling classification uncertainties
- Managing potential failures in content generation
- Logging system activities for monitoring and debugging

## 8. Performance Considerations

### 8.1 Model Loading

Consider implementing lazy loading or caching of models to improve startup time and memory usage.

### 8.2 Parallel Processing

For systems handling multiple requests, consider implementing parallel processing for classification and generation tasks.

## 9. Security and Privacy

Ensure that the system adheres to security best practices, especially when handling user inputs and potentially sensitive information in prompts or conversation history.

## 10. Future Improvements

3. Call `smart_multi_modal_content_generation` with the user's prompt, conversation history, and configuration.
4. Handle the returned content and explanation as appropriate for your application.

## 12. Conclusion

This integration architecture provides a flexible and powerful system for intelligent, multi-modal content generation. By combining prompt classification with specialized content generation handlers, it can adapt to a wide range of user requests while maintaining modularity and extensibility. As with any complex system, ongoing monitoring, maintenance, and improvement will be key to its long-term success and effectiveness.

    now another one for the previous one about sub-classifiers and their corrector (prompt class rectifier) using the same LLM-based approach.

Certainly. Here's a comprehensive documentation for the sub-classifiers and their corrector (prompt class rectifier) using an LLM-based approach:

# Sub-Classifiers and Prompt Class Rectifier Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This system employs a hierarchical classification approach with sub-classifiers and a prompt class rectifier to accurately determine the intent and requirements of user prompts. It uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform fine-grained classification and correction, ensuring robust and accurate prompt understanding.

## 2. System Overview

The system consists of two main components:

1. Sub-classifiers: A set of specialized classifiers for different aspects of the prompt
2. Prompt Class Rectifier: An LLM-based corrector that refines and validates classification results

## 3. Key Components

### 3.1 Sub-Classifiers

2. Each sub-classifier processes the prompt independently
3. Results from all sub-classifiers are collected
4. The Prompt Class Rectifier analyzes the original prompt and sub-classifier results
5. The rectifier produces a final, refined classification

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Sub-Classifiers

        inputs = self.tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding=True)
        outputs = self.model.generate(**inputs, max_length=500)
        refined_classification = self.tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

    initial_classifications = classify_prompt(prompt)
    refined_classification = rectifier.rectify(prompt, initial_classifications)
    return refined_classification
```

## 6. Design Choices and Rationale

### 6.1 Hierarchical Classification

The system uses multiple specialized sub-classifiers instead of a single, all-encompassing classifier.

Rationale: This allows for more focused and accurate classification of specific aspects of the prompt. It also makes the system more modular and easier to update or extend.

### 6.2 LLM-based Rectification

An LLM is used to validate and refine the results from the sub-classifiers.

Rationale: LLMs can understand context and nuances that might be missed by the more rigid sub-classifiers. They can also provide explanations for their decisions, making the system more interpretable.

### 6.3 Confidence Scores

Each classification includes a confidence score.

Rationale: This allows the system to express uncertainty and potentially trigger additional processing or human intervention for low-confidence cases.

### 6.4 Use of Pre-trained Models

The system leverages pre-trained models for both classification and rectification.

Rationale: Pre-trained models provide a strong starting point and can be fine-tuned on domain-specific data if needed.

## 7. Extensibility

### 7.1 Adding New Sub-Classifiers

New sub-classifiers can be added by training a new model and adding it to the `classify_prompt` function.

### 7.2 Updating the Rectifier

The prompt template for the rectifier can be modified to include new classification aspects or to adjust the refinement process.

## 8. Performance Considerations

- Consider using batch processing for handling multiple prompts simultaneously.
- Implement caching mechanisms for frequent or similar prompts.
- Optimize model loading and inference for production environments.

## 9. Future Improvements

1. Implement active learning to continuously improve sub-classifiers based on rectifier feedback.
2. Develop a more sophisticated parsing mechanism for the rectifier output.
3. Introduce a confidence threshold for automatic vs. human-in-the-loop processing.
4. Expand the system to handle multi-lingual prompts.
5. Integrate prompt reformulation capabilities to clarify ambiguous user inputs.

## 10. Usage Guidelines

1. Ensure all required models are properly installed and accessible.
2. Call `classify_and_rectify_prompt` with the user's prompt.
3. Use the refined classification to guide subsequent content generation or processing steps.
4. Monitor system performance and collect feedback for continuous improvement.

## 11. Conclusion

This LLM-based sub-classifier and rectifier system provides a robust and flexible approach to prompt understanding. By combining specialized classifiers with an intelligent rectification step, it can handle a wide range of prompts with high accuracy and

```

## 5. Design Choices and Rationale

### 5.1 Single LLM-based Classifier

Instead of multiple specialized classifiers, a single LLM is used for all classification tasks.

Rationale: This approach leverages the LLM's broad knowledge and ability to understand context, potentially leading to more nuanced and accurate classifications. It also simplifies the system architecture.

### 5.2 Comprehensive System Prompt

The system prompt includes detailed instructions, category definitions, and output format specifications.

Rationale: A well-crafted prompt guides the LLM to provide consistent, structured outputs and helps it understand the full scope of the classification task.

### 5.3 Multi-dimensional Classification

The system classifies inputs across multiple dimensions simultaneously.

Rationale: This provides a more comprehensive understanding of the user's intent and allows for more accurate downstream processing or content generation.

### 5.4 Confidence Scores and Explanations

Each classification includes a confidence score and a brief explanation.

Rationale: This adds interpretability to the system's decisions and allows for more nuanced handling of classifications, especially in edge cases.

### 5.5 JSON Output Format

The LLM is instructed to provide output in a structured JSON format.

Rationale: This makes it easy to parse and process the classification results programmatically.

## 6. Extensibility

### 6.1 Adding New Classification Dimensions

To add new classification dimensions:

1. Update the system prompt to include the new category, its definition, and examples.
2. Modify the output JSON structure in the prompt to include the new category.
3. Update the parsing logic in the `classify` method if necessary.

### 6.2 Fine-tuning for Specific Domains

The system can be adapted for specific domains by:

1. Fine-tuning the LLM on domain-specific data.
2. Adjusting the system prompt to include domain-specific categories or examples.

## 7. Performance Considerations

- Implement caching mechanisms for frequent or similar inputs to reduce API calls to the LLM.
- Consider batch processing for handling multiple inputs simultaneously.
- Monitor and optimize token usage to manage costs associated with LLM API calls.

## 8. Limitations and Mitigation Strategies

1. LLM Hallucinations: The LLM might occasionally generate plausible-sounding but incorrect classifications.
   Mitigation: Implement a secondary validation system or human-in-the-loop process for critical applications.

2. Inconsistent Formatting: The LLM might sometimes deviate from the specified JSON format.
   Mitigation: Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in the parsing logic.

3. Limited to Training Data: The LLM's knowledge is limited to its training data cutoff.
   Mitigation: Regularly update or fine-tune the model, or implement a retrieval-augmented generation approach for up-to-date information.

## 9. Future Improvements

1. Implement a feedback loop to continually improve classification accuracy based on downstream task performance.
2. Develop a hybrid system that combines LLM-based classification with traditional machine learning models for enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
3. Explore few-shot learning techniques to improve performance on rare or novel input types.
4. Implement an uncertainty threshold to trigger human review for low-confidence classifications.

## 10. Usage Guidelines

1. Initialize the `GlobalClassifier` with an appropriate LLM model.
2. Call the `classify` method with the user's input.
3. Process the returned classification dictionary as needed for downstream tasks.
4. Monitor classification quality and collect feedback for continuous improvement.

## 11. Conclusion

This LLM-based global classifier with well-crafted system prompts offers a flexible and powerful approach to input classification. By leveraging the broad knowledge and contextual understanding of LLMs, it can provide nuanced, multi-dimensional classifications that can significantly enhance the performance of downstream tasks in a content generation or processing pipeline. However, users should be aware of its limitations and implement appropriate safeguards for critical applications.

    i meant the global and sub classifiers documentation

I apologize for the misunderstanding. You're looking for the global and sub-classifiers documentation using the Ollama library syntax. Here's how you could structure that:

```python
import ollama

def global_classifier(text):
    """
    Classifies text into broad categories.

    Args:
    text (str): The text to classify.

    Returns:
    str: The broad category of the text.
    """
    prompt = f"""Classify the following text into one of these broad categories:
    - News
    - Opinion
    - Entertainment
    - Other

    Text: {text}

    Respond with just the category name."""

    response = ollama.chat(model='llama2', messages=[
        {'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}
    ])

    return response['message']['content'].strip()

def sub_classifier(text, global_category):
    """
    Classifies text into specific sub-categories based on the global category.

    Args:
    text (str): The text to classify.
    global_category (str): The broad category from the global classifier.

    Returns:
    str: The specific sub-category of the text.
    """
    sub_categories = {
        "News": ["Politics", "Technology", "Science", "Business", "Sports", "Health"],
        "Opinion": ["Editorial", "Column", "Letter to the Editor", "Review"],
        "Entertainment": ["Movie", "Music", "Television", "Celebrity", "Literature"],
        "Other": ["Education", "Travel", "Food", "Fashion", "Lifestyle"]
    }

    prompt = f"""Given that this text belongs to the {global_category} category,
    classify it into one of these sub-categories:
    {', '.join(sub_categories[global_category])}

    Text: {text}

    Respond with just the sub-category name."""

    response = ollama.chat(model='llama2', messages=[
        {'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}
    ])

    return response['message']['content'].strip()

# Example usage
def classify_text(text):
    """
    Performs both global and sub-classification on the given text.

    Args:
    text (str): The text to classify.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the global category and sub-category.
    """
    global_category = global_classifier(text)
    sub_category = sub_classifier(text, global_category)
    return global_category, sub_category

# Example
text = "SpaceX successfully launches Starship, marking a new era in space exploration"
global_cat, sub_cat = classify_text(text)
print(f"Global Category: {global_cat}")
print(f"Sub-Category: {sub_cat}")
```

This code structure:

1. Defines a `global_classifier` function that classifies text into broad categories.
2. Defines a `sub_classifier` function that further classifies the text into specific sub-categories based on the global category.
3. Uses the Ollama library to interact with the language model (in this case, 'llama2').
4. Provides a `classify_text` function that combines both classifiers.
5. Includes an example of how to use the classifier.

Remember to have Ollama set up and running with the appropriate model (like 'llama2') for this to work. You may need to adjust the model name or the categories based on your specific requirements and the capabilities of the model you're using.

    given this alignement mechanism,i want to take advantage of the information from the non textual modalities to create the final texual output from the llm which is in accordance with the output modality contents,

I understand. You want to leverage the information from non-textual modalities (like images and audio) to influence and refine the final textual output from the LLM, ensuring it aligns well with the content of all modalities. Here's an approach to achieve this using the Ollama library:

```python
import ollama
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import base64
import io

class MultiModalContentGenerator:
    def __init__(self, model='llama2'):
        self.model = model

    def generate_aligned_text(self, initial_prompt, image, audio):
        # Convert image to base64
        buffered = io.BytesIO()
        image.save(buffered, format="PNG")
        img_str = base64.b64encode(buffered.getvalue()).decode()

        # For simplicity, we'll assume audio is already processed into a text description
        # In a real scenario, you'd use speech recognition here
        audio_description = self._process_audio(audio)

        prompt = f"""Based on the following information, generate a coherent text output:

        Initial prompt: {initial_prompt}

        Image content: [A detailed description of the image. Analyze the image and describe its key elements, colors, objects, scenery, etc.]

        Audio content: {audio_description}

        Ensure the generated text aligns with and incorporates elements from both the image and audio content.
        The text should be coherent and naturally integrate details from all modalities.
        """

        response = ollama.chat(model=self.model, messages=[
            {'role': 'user', 'content': prompt},
            {'role': 'system', 'content': f'Analyze the following image: data:image/png;base64,{img_str}'}
        ])

        return response['message']['content']

    def _process_audio(self, audio):
        # Placeholder for audio processing
        # In a real implementation, you would use speech recognition here
        return "Audio description: [A person speaking about the beauty of nature]"

# Example usage
generator = MultiModalContentGenerator()

initial_prompt = "Create a description of a peaceful natural scene"
image = Image.open("nature_scene.jpg")
audio = np.random.rand(16000)  # Simulated audio data

aligned_text = generator.generate_aligned_text(initial_prompt, image, audio)
print(aligned_text)
```

This approach does the following:

1. We create a `MultiModalContentGenerator` class that uses Ollama to interact with the language model.

2. The `generate_aligned_text` method takes an initial prompt, an image, and audio as inputs.

3. We convert the image to a base64 string so it can be included in the prompt. Ollama and the underlying LLM (like llama2) may have image processing capabilities, allowing them to analyze the image content.

4. For audio, we include a placeholder `_process_audio` method. In a real implementation, you would use speech recognition to convert the audio to text or extract key information from it.

5. We construct a detailed prompt that includes:

   - The initial text prompt
   - Instructions to analyze the image
   - The processed audio content
   - Clear instructions to align the output with all modalities

6. We use `ollama.chat()` to send this multi-modal prompt to the model. The image is passed as a system message using the base64 encoding.

7. The model generates text that should be aligned with and incorporate elements from all modalities.

To further improve this system:

1. Implement proper audio processing, using a speech recognition model to convert audio to text.

2. Fine-tune the language model on multi-modal tasks to improve its ability to integrate information from different modalities.

3. Implement a feedback loop where the generated text is checked against the image and audio content for accuracy and coherence.

4. Add more specific instructions in the prompt about how to integrate information from each modality.

5. Consider using a more advanced multi-modal model that can directly process image and audio inputs alongside text.

6. Implement error handling and validation to ensure all inputs are properly formatted and processed.

This approach allows you to generate text that is informed by and aligned with the content of other modalities, creating a more coherent and comprehensive multi-modal output.

    implement this one :
        # For simplicity, we'll assume audio is already processed into a text description
        # In a real scenario, you'd use speech recognition here

Certainly! I'll implement a more realistic audio processing step using a speech recognition model. We'll use the SpeechRecognition library, which provides an interface to several speech recognition engines and APIs. For this example, we'll use Google's Speech Recognition API, which is free for limited use.

Here's the updated implementation:

```python
import ollama
from PIL import Image

import base64
import io
import speech_recognition as sr
from pydub import AudioSegment

        img_str = base64.b64encode(buffered.getvalue()).decode()

        # Process audio into text
        audio_description = self._process_audio(audio)

        prompt = f"""Based on the following information, generate a coherent text output:

        response = ollama.chat(model=self.model, messages=[

        ])

        return response['message']['content']

    def _process_audio(self, audio):
        # Convert numpy array to AudioSegment
        audio_segment = AudioSegment(
            audio.tobytes(),
            frame_rate=16000,
            sample_width=audio.dtype.itemsize,
            channels=1
        )

        # Export AudioSegment to a temporary WAV file
        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=".wav", delete=False) as temp_wav:
            audio_segment.export(temp_wav.name, format="wav")
            temp_wav_path = temp_wav.name

        # Use speech recognition on the temporary file
        with sr.AudioFile(temp_wav_path) as source:
            audio_data = self.recognizer.record(source)
            try:
                text = self.recognizer.recognize_google(audio_data)
                return f"Audio transcription: {text}"
            except sr.UnknownValueError:
                return "Audio transcription: Speech could not be understood"
            except sr.RequestError as e:
                return f"Audio transcription: Could not request results; {e}"

# Example usage
generator = MultiModalContentGenerator()

initial_prompt = "Create a description of a peaceful natural scene"
image = Image.open("nature_scene.jpg")

# Generate a simple audio signal (sine wave) for demonstration
duration = 5  # seconds
frequency = 440  # Hz
t = np.linspace(0, duration, int(16000 * duration), False)
audio = np.sin(2 * np.pi * frequency * t) * 32767
audio = audio.astype(np.int16)

aligned_text = generator.generate_aligned_text(initial_prompt, image, audio)
print(aligned_text)
```

This implementation does the following:

1. We import the necessary libraries: `speech_recognition` for speech-to-text conversion, and `pydub` for audio file manipulation.

2. In the `_process_audio` method:

   - We convert the numpy array to an `AudioSegment` object, which is more easily manipulated.
   - We export this `AudioSegment` to a temporary WAV file.
   - We use Google's Speech Recognition API (via the `SpeechRecognition` library) to transcribe the audio.
   - We return the transcribed text, or an error message if transcription fails.

3. The rest of the `MultiModalContentGenerator` class remains largely the same, but now incorporates the actual transcribed audio content instead of a placeholder.

4. In the example usage, we generate a simple sine wave audio signal for demonstration purposes. In a real scenario, you would load actual audio data here.

This implementation provides a more realistic approach to processing audio input. Some points to consider:

- The Google Speech Recognition API requires an internet connection and may have usage limits.
- For production use, you might want to consider using a local speech recognition model or a paid API with higher limits and better accuracy.
- The audio processing might fail for various reasons (no speech detected, poor audio quality, etc.). The implementation includes basic error handling, but you might want to expand on this.
- This implementation assumes mono audio at 16kHz sample rate. You might need to adjust the parameters if your audio input differs.

Remember to install the required libraries:

```
pip install SpeechRecognition pydub
```

Also, you may need to install additional dependencies for working with audio files, such as `ffmpeg`. The exact process for this depends on your operating system.

    here rather than simulated use AudioLDM for the sound generation
    ```python
    audio = np.random.rand(16000)  # Simulated audio data
    ```

    here is an examples

    ```python
    from diffusers import AudioLDMPipeline

    import torch

    import scipy

    repo_id = "cvssp/audioldm-s-full-v2"

    pipe = AudioLDMPipeline.from_pretrained(repo_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)

    pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

    prompt = "Techno music with a strong, upbeat tempo and high melodic riffs"

    audio = pipe(prompt, num_inference_steps=10, audio_length_in_s=5.0).audios[0]

    # save the audio sample as a .wav file

    scipy.io.wavfile.write("techno.wav", rate=16000, data=audio)
    ```

Certainly! I'll modify the code to use AudioLDM for sound generation based on a text prompt. This will create a more coherent multi-modal experience, as the audio will be generated to match the initial prompt. Here's the updated implementation:

```python

# Optionally, save the generated audio
audio = generator.generate_audio(initial_prompt)
scipy.io.wavfile.write("generated_audio.wav", rate=16000, data=audio)
```

This implementation does the following:

1. We import the necessary libraries, including `AudioLDMPipeline` from `diffusers`.

2. In the `MultiModalContentGenerator` class:

   - We initialize the AudioLDM pipeline in the constructor.
   - We add a `generate_audio` method that uses AudioLDM to generate audio based on a text prompt.
   - We modify the `generate_aligned_text` method to generate audio based on the initial prompt, rather than taking audio as an input.

3. The `_process_audio` method remains largely the same, processing the generated audio into text.

4. In the example usage:
   - We only need to provide the initial prompt and the image.
   - The audio is generated based on the initial prompt.
   - We've added an optional step to save the generated audio as a WAV file.

This implementation provides a fully integrated multi-modal content generation pipeline:

- The initial prompt is used to generate both text and audio.
- The generated audio is transcribed and incorporated into the final text generation.
- The image is analyzed and incorporated into the final text generation.
- The final text output should coherently integrate elements from the initial prompt, the image, and the generated audio.

Remember to install the required libraries:

```
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate
```

Also, ensure you have PyTorch installed with CUDA support for optimal performance.

This approach creates a more coherent multi-modal experience, as all elements (text, image, and audio) are generated or processed based on the same initial prompt.

    ```python
            response = ollama.chat(model=self.model, messages=[

Thank you for that clarification. You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Let's update the code to use the correct method for passing images to Ollama. Here's the corrected version of the `generate_aligned_text` method:

```python

        """

        system_prompt = "You are a multi-modal content analyzer and generator. Analyze the provided image and incorporate its details into your response."

        response = ollama.generate(
            model=self.model,
            prompt=prompt,
            system=system_prompt,
            images=[temp_image_path]
        )

        return response['response']

    # ... (rest of the class methods)
```

This updated version does the following:

1. We save the PIL Image object to a temporary file. This gives us a file path we can pass to Ollama.

2. We use `ollama.generate()` instead of `ollama.chat()`.

3. We pass the prompt, system prompt, and image file path to `ollama.generate()`.

4. We extract the response from the 'response' key of the returned dictionary.

This approach correctly utilizes Ollama's image processing capabilities, allowing the model to directly analyze the image content along with the text prompt.

Also, note that depending on the Ollama model you're using, you might need to ensure it supports multi-modal inputs (text and image). Models like llama2 might not have this capability, so you may need to use a model specifically designed for multi-modal tasks.

Thank you for pointing out the correct method. This updated version should work more effectively with Ollama's image processing capabilities.
