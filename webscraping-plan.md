this was the project presentation first slides,

we continue now by following this outline in our ppt

1. Introduction
2. Design Choice (LLMs and Diffusers)
3. Transformers
4. Datasets (you're here now with the BERT text Classifier dataset collection and annotation )
5. Overall Architecture
6. Design Methodology
7. Experiments and Results
8. Conclusion and Future works

now based on the documents provided about how Dataset Collection, Cleaning, and Annotation done and how webscrappers are built by scrapping an online prompts websites like

```

https://lexica.art/
https://playground.com/feed
https://tensor.art
https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/blob/main/prompts.csv
```

now in the next three slides explain how to do

1. data collection (showing the steps for building a webscrapper)
2. data cleaning (showing the steps based on the provided pdf)
3. data annotation (showing the steps of saving the data in a json format {"prompt":<prompt>, "global-classification":<global-classification>, "sub-classification":<sub-classification>}

create me a 5 slides summarizing them in very professional way
while proposing some images and illustration by adding <figure or image about [the topic]> where it should be

Slide 7: Transition to Dataset Preparation

Title: From Architecture to Data: Preparing for Multi-Modal Learning

Bridging Theory and Practice:
• Moving from architectural design to practical implementation
• Crucial role of high-quality, diverse datasets in training MM-LLM systems

Upcoming Focus: Dataset Collection, Cleaning, and Annotation

Key Aspects:

1. Web Scraping Techniques

   - Gathering diverse, real-world data
   - Ensuring broad coverage of modalities and topics

2. Curated Datasets

   - DiffusionDB for image generation tasks
   - WikiSQL for question-answering capabilities
   - CC-Stories (or STORIES) for common sense reasoning and creative writing
   - Prompt Engineering and Responses (Kaggle) for various prompt types and responses

3. Dataset Adaptation

   - Aligning existing datasets with our classification schema:
     • Text2Image, Text2Audio, Text2Text, Image2Text, Audio2Text
   - Potential need for additional labeling or categorization

4. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

   - Ensuring data quality and relevance
   - Standardizing formats across different datasets
   - Handling missing data or inconsistencies

5. Annotation for Classification
   - Labeling data for global and sub-classifier training
   - Ensuring balanced representation across classes

Next Steps: Detailed exploration of dataset preparation and integration processes
