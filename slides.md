### Slide 3: Abstract

NExT-GPT is presented as an end-to-end general-purpose any-to-any Multimodal Large Language Model (MM-LLM). It connects an LLM with multimodal adaptors and diffusion decoders, enabling universal multimodal understanding and generation of text, images, videos, and audio. NExT-GPT leverages existing encoders and decoders, fine-tuned with minimal parameters, ensuring low-cost training and potential expansion. A high-quality modality-switching instruction tuning dataset (MosIT) is curated to enhance cross-modal semantic understanding and content generation.

---

### Slide 4: Introduction (Part 1)

Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) include technologies like ChatGPT for text and diffusion models for visuals. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Flan-T5, Vicuna, LLaMA, and Alpaca has been significant, highlighting their language reasoning and decision-making capabilities, crucial for pursuing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

---

### Slide 5: Introduction (Part 2)

Human perception is inherently multimodal, combining language, images, videos, and sounds. Current MM-LLMs primarily focus on input-side multimodal understanding but lack the ability to output content in multiple modalities. Achieving real AGI necessitates developing any-to-any MM-LLMs for seamless input and output in any modality combination.

---

### Slide 6: Related Work (3.1 Cross-modal Understanding and Generation)

Cross-modal learning tasks include Image/Video Captioning, Question Answering, and Text-to-Image/Video/Speech Synthesis. Effective multimodal encoders and various generation methods like Transformers, GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models have been proposed. CoDi represents a recent breakthrough in generating any combination of output modalities but lacks deep reasoning.

---

### Slide 7: Related Work (3.2 Multimodal Large Language Models)

LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 have revolutionized AI with their language understanding and reasoning. MM-LLMs align modality-specific encoders to the textual feature space of LLMs. Examples include Flamingo, BLIP-2, LLaVA, and PandaGPT. However, these models mainly perceive multimodal data without generating arbitrary modality content.

---

### Slide 8: Overall Architecture (Part 1)

NExT-GPT's framework consists of three main tiers:

1. **Encoding Stage:** Uses pre-trained models to encode inputs from various modalities.
2. **LLM Understanding and Reasoning Stage:** Processes input information for semantic understanding and reasoning, generating text tokens and modality signal tokens as instructions for decoding layers.

---

### Slide 9: Overall Architecture (Part 2)

3. **Decoding Stage:** Converts multimodal signals into corresponding outputs. NExT-GPT employs existing high-performance encoders and decoders, minimizing computational overhead by fine-tuning only the input and output projection layers, ensuring efficient alignment across the three tiers.

---

### Slide 10: Multimodal Encoding Stage (4.1)

The encoding stage utilizes established models like Q-Former, ViT, and CLIP to encode inputs from various modalities. NExT-GPT leverages ImageBind, a unified encoder across six modalities, enabling seamless management of multimodal inputs.

---

### Slide 11: LLM Understanding and Reasoning Stage (4.2)

The LLM understanding and reasoning stage involves leveraging an open-sourced LLM to process multimodal input representations. The LLM generates text tokens and modality signal tokens that instruct the decoding layers on the content and modality of the output. This stage ensures that the LLM comprehends the semantic meaning of the inputs and reasons accordingly.

---

### Slide 12: Multimodal Decoding Stage (4.3)

The decoding stage employs various pre-trained decoders to generate outputs in the desired modality. The modality signal tokens guide the decoders to produce content in text, images, videos, or audio. By using off-the-shelf parameters and fine-tuning only the projection layers, NExT-GPT efficiently decodes multimodal signals into corresponding outputs.

---

### Slide 13: Methodology (5.1 Modality-Switching Instruction Tuning - MosIT)

Modality-Switching Instruction Tuning (MosIT) is introduced to enhance NExT-GPT's cross-modal semantic understanding and content generation. MosIT involves training the model to understand and follow complex cross-modal instructions, enabling fluid transitions between different modalities.

---

### Slide 14: Dataset Collection and Annotation (5.2)

A high-quality dataset for MosIT is manually curated, comprising 5,000 samples with intricate instructions across various modal combinations. This dataset is crucial for training NExT-GPT to handle complex cross-modal tasks and generate accurate and coherent outputs in any modality.

---

### Slide 15: Training and Fine-Tuning (5.3)

NExT-GPT is fine-tuned using the annotated MosIT dataset. The training process involves updating the input and output projection layers and certain LLM parameters using the LoRA technique. This approach ensures efficient training with minimal computational overhead while enhancing the model's cross-modal capabilities.

---

### Slide 16: Experiments and Results (6.1 Evaluation Metrics)

NExT-GPT's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, coherence, and fidelity of the generated outputs. These metrics assess the model's ability to understand and generate content across different modalities accurately.

---

### Slide 17: Comparison with Baseline Models (6.2)

NExT-GPT is compared with existing baseline models such as BLIP-2, Flamingo, and CoDi. The comparison highlights NExT-GPT's superior performance in handling any-to-any modality conversion, showcasing its advanced reasoning and content generation capabilities.

---

### Slide 18: Ablation Studies (6.3)

Ablation studies are conducted to analyze the impact of different components and fine-tuning techniques on NExT-GPT's performance. These studies help identify the most critical elements contributing to the model's effectiveness and guide future improvements.

---

### Slide 19: Discussion (7.1 Strengths and Contributions)

NExT-GPT's strengths include its ability to handle any-to-any modality input and output, efficient training with minimal parameter adjustments, and advanced cross-modal semantic understanding. The project contributes a novel approach to developing human-like AI with universal multimodal capabilities.

---

### Slide 20: Discussion (7.2 Limitations and Future Work)

Despite its strengths, NExT-GPT has limitations, such as potential challenges in scaling to more modalities and handling extremely complex instructions. Future work will focus on expanding the model's capabilities, improving scalability, and exploring new applications in diverse fields.

---

### Slide 21: Conclusion

NExT-GPT represents a significant advancement in MM-LLMs, enabling universal multimodal understanding and generation. By seamlessly integrating various modalities, NExT-GPT paves the way for more human-like AI research and applications, bringing us closer to achieving real AGI.
