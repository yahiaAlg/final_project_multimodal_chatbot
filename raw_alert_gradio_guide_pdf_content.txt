Alerts
Gradio Team
You may wish to display alerts to the user. To do so, raise a gr.Error("custom message")  in your
function to halt the execution of your function and display an error message to the user.
Alternatively, can issue gr.Warning("custom message")  or gr.Info("custom message")  by having them
as standalone lines in your function, which will immediately display modals while continuing the
execution of your function. The only difference between gr.Info()  and gr.Warning()  is the color of
the alert.
def start_process(name):
    gr.Info("Starting process")
if name is None:
        gr.Warning("Name is empty")
...
if success == False:
raise gr.Error("Process failed")

  Tip:</strong> Note that `gr.Error()` is  an exception that has to be raised
