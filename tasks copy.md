## prelude

Here's a revised version of the prelude, addressing the points you mentioned:

Imagine standing at the edge of a vast, uncharted sea. The year is 1950, and you're about to witness events that will reshape the very fabric of human civilization.

The journey begins with visionaries like Alan Turing, who dared to ask, "Can machines think?" From these first whispers, a world of endless possibilities has emerged. In the following decades, a wave of innovation, setbacks, and breakthroughs let us witness the birth of neural networks, mirroring the intricate pathways of the human brain.

The 1956 Dartmouth Conference marked the official birth of AI as a field. However, progress wasn't linear. The field faced significant challenges, including the AI winters of the 1970s and 1980s, where funding dried up and progress in AI research seemed frozen. Yet, like spring following winter, the 1990s saw a resurgence with the rise of machine learning, culminating in IBM's Deep Blue defeating world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.

The past two decades have seen tremendous advancements in domains like big data and deep learning. These technologies have unlocked capabilities once thought impossible:

- Languages deciphered by neural machine translation systems
- Photorealistic images generated from mere text descriptions
- Conversations held with algorithms so advanced they blur the line between artificial and human intelligence

However, this rapid progress has not been without its challenges. Concerns about privacy, job displacement, and the potential misuse of AI technologies have sparked intense ethical debates.

Today, we stand at the precipice of a new era. The latest innovations like large language models and diffusion models are paving the way for another industrial revolution. These powerful tools, akin to Aladdin's lamp, leave us with multiple questions: How can we harness this technology for the greater good? How do we ensure equitable access and prevent the widening of societal divides? How can we build a bright future for ourselves and for generations to come, while mitigating potential risks?

As we navigate these uncharted waters, one thing is clear: the decisions we make today will shape the role of AI in our society for decades to come.

Slide 7: Transition to Dataset Preparation
<speech vocalist="oussama">

"As we move from architectural design to practical implementation, we now turn our attention to a critical aspect of training multi-modal large language models: dataset preparation.

High-quality, diverse datasets are the foundation of effective MM-LLM systems. Our focus will be on five key areas:

1.  Web scraping techniques to gather diverse, real-world data across various modalities and topics.

2.  Utilization of curated datasets like DiffusionDB, WikiSQL, and CC-Stories to enhance specific capabilities.

3.  Dataset adaptation to align existing data with our classification schema.

4.  Rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure quality and standardization.

5.  Annotation for classification to support both global and sub-classifier training.

These steps will prepare us for the complex task of training our MM-LLM system. In our next session, we'll dive deeper into each of these processes, exploring how they contribute to building a robust and versatile model."

<speech vocalist="oussama">
   "Now that we've outlined our dataset preparation strategy, let's dive into the practical aspects of data collection, cleaning, and annotation.

For data collection, we'll build a web scraper using Python libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup. This involves setting up our environment, fetching HTML content, parsing it, and extracting the data we need. We'll also handle pagination for comprehensive data gathering.

Moving on to data cleaning, we'll use the Pyjanitor library along with pandas. This powerful combination allows us to efficiently clean column names, handle missing values, filter rows, and select relevant columns. By chaining methods, we can create a streamlined cleaning process.

Finally, for data annotation, we'll focus on saving our cleaned data in JSON format. We'll create a custom annotation function, apply it to our dataset, and then save the annotated data as JSON. This format is ideal for our classification tasks, as it allows us to clearly structure our prompts, global classifications, and sub-classifications.

Throughout this process, we'll prioritize data quality, consistency, and proper formatting to ensure our MM-LLM system has the best possible foundation for training.

description of MM-LLM System Architecture and Prompt Classification

The MM-LLM system architecture is designed for efficient multi-modal processing and generation.

- It begins with a sophisticated input processing stage, where a Global Classifier, powered by BERT Decoder only transformer architecture analyzes prompts to determine the required modalities. Specialized sub-classifiers then handle specific modal transitions and the tasks within the same modality like text-to-image or audio-to-text.
  The core processing unit, featuring a Prompt Rectification Unit and an advanced LLM (such as Vicuna or Phi-3), performs deep semantic analysis and reasoning.
- For output generation, the system employs state-of-the-art diffusion models tailored to each modality – Stable Diffusion for images, AudioLDM for sound, MeloTTS/gtts/FacebookTTs for speech, and a Vision Transformer like Meta LLava and Google Gemini-pro-vison for visual tasks.
- A Modality Alignment Unit ensures coherent integration of multi-modal outputs. This streamlined workflow allows for flexible, context-aware processing of complex multi-modal prompts, resulting in rich, diverse, and contextually appropriate responses across various modalities."""

"Now that we've covered our overall architecture and it's process, let's dive into the exciting results of our experiments with BERT-based models for prompt classification and the overall performance of our multi-modal system."

<speech vocalist="oussama">

"Let's examine the results of our experiments with RoBERTa, BERT, and DistilBERT for modality classification.

RoBERTa demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving near-perfect accuracy by the 4th epoch. It maintained high performance throughout training, ending with 97.5% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.975. The rapid convergence and low final loss values indicate efficient learning and excellent generalization.

BERT also performed well, showing steady improvement over the training period. It achieved 95% accuracy by the 18th epoch, with an F1 score of 0.95. While not as quick to converge as RoBERTa, BERT proved to be a solid performer for this task.

Surprisingly, DistilBERT struggled significantly with this classification task. Despite training for 20 epochs, it showed limited improvement, reaching only 40% accuracy. This suggests that the task complexity might exceed DistilBERT's capacity, at least with the current hyperparameters and dataset.

These results highlight RoBERTa as the clear choice for our modality classification task, with BERT as a strong alternative. The poor performance of DistilBERT suggests that model compression may not be suitable for this particular application without significant modifications or additional techniques.

Moving forward, we should focus on fine-tuning RoBERTa and possibly BERT, exploring ways to further improve their already strong performance. For DistilBERT, we may need to reassess its applicability or investigate alternative lightweight models if computation efficiency is a priority."
