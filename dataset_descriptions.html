      CommonCrawl dataset that has the most overlapping n-grams with the
      questions in commonsense reasoning tasks. The top 1.0% of highest ranked
      documents is chosen as the new training corpus.

    <p>
      This is a collection of prompt examples to be used with the ChatGPT model.
      The ChatGPT model is a large language model trained by OpenAI that is
      capable of generating human-like text. By providing it with a prompt, it
      can generate responses that continue the conversation or expand on the
      given prompt.
